	The Wardrobe application allows the user to select clothing items and uploads them to the site by inputting a url for the image.
The wardrobe is automatically divided into types by clothing(ex: tops,bottoms, ect.), making it easy for the user to view their selection.
Finally, there is an outfit page, where the user can select between their uploaded items and compile them into one outfit.
